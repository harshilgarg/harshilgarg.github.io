            <p class="firstp">PRISM is a clandestine operation funded, developed, and maintained by the National Security Agency (NSA), 
               which is exclusively designed to monitor private communication and electronic activities in the United States, 
               and even on an international scale to some degree. PRISM is the latest evolution of the US government's extensive efforts to counter 
               terrorism after 9/11 which initiated with the Patriot Act under President Bush and has since expanded to the Foreign Intelligence 
               Surveillance Act (FISA). Since its creation in 2007, experts claim that PRISM has exploited provisions in the United States penal 
               code to pressure companies with heavy Internet traffic, like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft, into providing private user data. 
               With this server access, the NSA has a direct pipeline to user search history, email content, file transfers, live chats, and records 
               of many other personal and private Internet activities.

                  required to fork over user data to the NSA. However, in the aftermath, the implicated 
                  companies vehemently denied knowledge of and participation in PRISM and rejected allegations

               <p>The NSA collects millions of records daily from a variety of sources. Although PRISM primarily monitors foreign communications, most global Internet bandwidth communications move through the United States anyways. 
                  This indicates clearly that the PRISM has a much larger scope and direct impact on domestic matters than portrayed by the NSA.

                <p>Perhaps it can be argued that surely the NSA filters vast amounts of data, and only records and stores exceptionally suspicious data. However, since 1999, there has been near exponential growth in NSA's data collection, and it has almost reached
                     850 billion records. It is likely that in addition to sensitive information, the NSA has extraneous records as well, and in a case where privacy need not be compromised for national security, it is unacceptable for the NSA to hold on to these records.

            <p>The NSA is essentially extrapolating its power sphere and violating the terms of search and surveillance as most American citizens understand it. PRISM collects mostly Internet-based content, but other programs maintained by the NSA even tracks phone contents and metadata. As mentioned earlier, there is a definite inadvertent data collection of private individuals; even more discomforting is that it is not immediately cleared and can remain stored for five years. 
        The NSA simply casts way too wide of a net, yet surprisingly so, many of their practices are grounded in judicial approval and passed legislation. </p>

            <div class="largehead">The Inherent Controversy between Security, Legality, and Ethicality</div>
            <p></p>
            <div class="smallhead">Legal Acrobatics: NSA exploits the law.</div>
            <p>PRISM was chartered in 2007 under the Protect America Act. It was intended to streamline surveillance practices conducted by the NSA since the unfortunate terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. However, the PRISM program completely undermines the core tenets of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which was originally created as a check to prevent the NSA from overextending its authority. Under FISA, surveillance agencies must make a case to intelligence courts, identifying the target and argue for the validity of the surveillance based on basic probable cause. However, the addition of Section 702 (first passed in the 2008 Amendments and later reauthorized in 2012) effectively nullified the checks in place, fundamentally granting the NSA free reign to collect, store, and analyze surveillance records as it pleased.</p>
            <div class="smallhead">The NSA violates the Fourth Amendment.</div>
            <p>The Fourth Amendment states:</p>
            <div class="bc2">
                  <div class="quote">"People have a right to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</div>
                  <div class="source">&mdash; Cornell University Law School</div>
            </div>
            <p>The government has been able to defend the legality of PRISM and similar programs in the past because of compliance with FISA and its amendments. Section 702 holds in the Supreme Court because the Fourth Amendment does not protect foreigners from searches conducted abroad. However, it seems quite disingenuous that in targeting foreign communications that millions of American citizen records can be compromised; this inadvertency is treated as an occasional mistake, and not an internal flaw in the system, almost as if it cannot be helped. This is where the problem lies; as soon as the US government recognizes that because current surveillance procedures infringe on the privacy rights of Americans, it becomes clear that the Fourth Amendment rights are violated, especially since Section 702 does not require warrants anymore. Essentially, the NSA is disregarding the millions of records collected of Americans, passing it off as an unavoidable circumstance; in reality, PRISM should be shut down for its inability to filter relevant records.</p>
               <div class="smallhead">
                  Who checks the power of the NSA? FISC? Not really.
               </div>
               <p>The FISA court (FISC) oversees the legality of PRISM's surveillance, convenes in secret, and does not release specifics of the case. It is responsible for barring illegal activities by United States intelligence agencies, placing national agencies under the same legal constraints as regular police.
                  The problem, however, is that the restriction mechanisms are corrupt, as explained in the video below:

            	of mass surveillance altogether. In 2014, the Charlie Hebdo and French grocery store attackers were not only known to French and US authorities but one had a prior terrorism conviction and another was monitored for years by authorities. In 2013, similarly, government agencies failed to properly coordinate and share information about Tsarnaev, resulting in the infamous Boston Marathon bombing. According to the Washington post, an analysis of 225 terrorism cases inside the United States has concluded that the bulk collection of phone records has had no discernible impact in preventing acts of terrorism.

Also, the 2009 data is incomplete. In all, this shows that NSA surveillance may not be the most effective tool for prevention of terrorism.</div>

            	<p>Obama makes a very reasonable statement here, and it is definitely true. According to a poll, more Americans are feeling the tensions between privacy and security concerns as of February 2016, especially after the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, and the ideological and philosophical debate Apple waged with the US government.</p>
            	<div class="smallhead">What does the public think?</div>
					<img src="img/poll1.png" width="40%" style="float:left;margin-top:20px;">
					<p>Right away, it is evident that overall the majority of the United States is uncomfortable with the current surveillance programs maintained by the US government. Although there are deviations amongst party lines, it is an overwhelming difference of almost 14% more people.</p>
					<img src="img/poll2.png" width="60%" style="float:right;margin-top:5px; margin-left:15px;">
					<p>Since international diplomacy is always an important concern, especially when relating to a superpower like the United States which is responsible for polarizing the Western and non-Western worlds, surveillance of other countries is dangerous for the sanctity of relations. On average, 81% of citizens in that country don't support American surveillance, as expected. NSA PRISM should stop targeting foreign targets that do not pose considerable threats.</p>
					<p>After Snowden leaked the classified NSA information, there was considerable outrage from many international allies. Here is a statement from the European Parliament President, Martin Schulz:</p>
					<div class="bc2">
                  <div class="quote">"If the allegations prove to be true, it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on EU-US relations.

					<p>The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, launched a blistering attack at President Obama, accusing the NSA of international rights violations. Corporate information – often of high economic and even strategic value – was at the centre of espionage activity. There was also considerable anger at the realization
					that surveillance meant that the United States did not believe Brazil could protect itself from harbouring terrorist groups. She concluded with this statement:</p>
					<div class="bc2">
                  <div class="quote">"As many other Latin Americans, I fought against authoritarianism and censorship and I cannot but defend, in an uncompromising fashion, the right to privacy of individuals and the sovereignty of my country.

					<p>Considering that 49% of the population believes that the Snowden leak serves the general public, it is odd to note that 54% would still considering prosecuting him. There is definitely a disconnect and stigma that results from the exile of Edward Snowden, governmental disapproval, and controversy that surrounds this situation that compels people to demand his prosecution. The more telling statistic is still definitely that most people believe Snowden released important information. I think perhaps more crucial is that there is widespread debate about this sensitive topic of the disconnect between security and privacy, and conversation is needed to understand the deep-seated problems with secret NSA operations.</p>
					<img src="img/poll4.png" width="40%" style="float:left; margin-top: -8px;margin-left:-10px;margin-right:8px;">

					<p>Finally, in the younger adult populations, specifically the social media generation, most believe that Snowden is a hero and served public interest, whereas older people generally hold that Snowden compromised the security of the United States. From an analytical perspective, the surveillance mechanisms are more understood by age groups familiar with the Internet revolution, and it is notable that the younger age groups are firmly in support of Snowden.</p>
