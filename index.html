	<p class="firstp">PRISM is a clandestine operation funded, developed, and maintained by the National Security Agency (NSA), 
	which is exclusively designed to monitor private communication and electronic activities in the United States, 
	and even on an international scale to some degree. PRISM is the latest evolution of the US government's extensive efforts to counter 
	terrorism after 9/11 which initiated with the Patriot Act under President Bush and has since expanded to the Foreign Intelligence 
	Surveillance Act (FISA). Since its creation in 2007, experts claim that PRISM has exploited provisions in the United States penal 
	code to pressure companies with heavy Internet traffic, like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft, into providing private user data. 
	With this server access, the NSA has a direct pipeline to user search history, email content, file transfers, live chats, and records 
	of many other personal and private Internet activities.</p>

 		<p>PRISM's operations were highly secretive until exposed by a former Booz Allen Hamilton 
 		security contractor, Edward Snowden. He released slides detailing how nine companies are 
 		required to fork over user data to the NSA. However, in the aftermath, the implicated 
 		companies vehemently denied knowledge of and participation in PRISM and rejected allegations 
 		that the US government is able to directly tap into users' data.</p>

	PRISM provides the FBI and NSA access to virtually all forms of online communication. According to the provisions of the legislations 
	that indirectly permit the existence of PRISM, only non-American citizens outside of the United States can be targeted. However, 
	incidental data from American citizens is still collected inadvertently by this program, but supposedly minimized. 
	Most troubling, however, is the disregard for the basic privacy rights that are explicitly enumerated in the United States Constitution.</p>
	<p>By using underseas cable taps, data hubs, and satellite signal receptors peppered throughout the United States, the NSA can intercept 
	civilian communications as shown below. With this advanced technology, it is clear that collecting private American citizen data is unavoidable.</p>
